## Experimental features
- **Contextual highlighting**: This feature will compare the text contained in the notes and the text displayed on the webpage, and if the two are in agreement, it will highlight them on the webpage. See demo below. You can enable this by setting the contextual highlighting to true when configuring the extension.
