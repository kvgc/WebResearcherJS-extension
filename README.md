WebResearcherJS is a Firefox extension which allows users to take notes on webpages and exporting the notes to TiddlyWiki5 and Joplin for further parsing. 

Try out the extension by downloading from the Firefox add-on page: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webresearcherjs/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webresearcherjs/)

### !!Important!!: Always backup your browser storage!!
The notes that are taken with WebResearcherJS are stored in the browser's localStorage. In order to prevent any data loss, always backup your browser's localStorage. This is typically stored in webappsstore.sqlite under your local firefox profile folder.
